# Description

This is a calculator that has been made from zero, it dosen't use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html">math</a> library function. Right now can only perfom basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Also in the last version has been added roots <a href=#how-to-install-and-use>more info</a>. I have used python in this project, as it is known as a language widely used in statistics. It is also the one I am most skilled in. I hope over the days when I update the project to add more mathematical functions such as:

- Logarithms
- Mathematical Limits
- Trigonometry
- Basic Algebra

# How to Install and Use
Currently the project was developed in <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3124">python</a> 3.12.4. In order to run the project you need to have python installed. As it has been made from zero it does not need any external libraries as everything is developed with the basic functions provided by the programming language.

**WINDOWS**

``py calculator.py`` or ``python3 calculator.py``

**LINUX AND MACOS**

``python3 calculator.py``

To use it is quite simple, all you need to do is follow the different instructions that appear on the screen. For example this:

``Welcome to the calculator please enter the followings symbols to make a calculation.``
